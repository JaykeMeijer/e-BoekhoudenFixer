# e-BoekhoudenFixer

Greasemonkey script to make the e-Boekhouden overview page more useful. By default it just shows all the entries for the entire month in one big list, which is very unclear. This script adds the following features:

- Entries grouped by day, and showing total of hours per day
- Allow a day to be minimized, hiding the entries of that day
- Shortcut buttons to show just current day, week and month
- Button per day to add entries for that day
- Allow timeframe selection box at the top to be minimized, as this takes up almost half of the page
- Automatically select '2. Investering' as activiteit, as we don't use the other anymore

## Installation

First, install GreaseMonkey for [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or TamperMonkey for [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/), [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) or [Safari](https://tampermonkey.net/?browser=safari).

Next, click [here](https://github.com/JaykeMeijer/e-BoekhoudenFixer/raw/master/eboekhouden.user.js).

This has for now only been tested on FireFox.
