# e-BoekhoudenFixer

Greasemonkey script to make the e-Boekhouden overview page more useful. By default it just shows all the entries for the entire month in one big list, which is very unclear. This script adds the following features:

- Entries grouped by day, and showing total of hours per day
- Allow a day to be minimized, hiding the entries of that day

The following features are to be added:

- Button to show just current week, instead of month
- Button to minimize all except current day
- Maybe: Button per day to add entries for that day

## Installation

First, install GreaseMonkey for [FireFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or TamperMonkey for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) or [Safari](https://tampermonkey.net/?browser=safari).

Next, click [here](https://github.com/JaykeMeijer/e-BoekhoudenFixer/raw/master/eboekhouden.user.js).

This has for now only been tested on FireFox.
